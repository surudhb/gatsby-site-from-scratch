- Created and maintained a library of custom UI components for over a dozen clients in <b>React Storybook</b><br/><br/>
- Aided in transitioning and testing core backend and asset migration from <b>Ruby</b> to <b>Webpack</b><br/><br/>
- Troubleshooted and polished various <b>Docker</b> builds for different internal environments<br/><br/>
  <b>Highlight</b>:<br/>Frontend had always been a challenge and an overwhelming black box for me and being put in the deep end allowed me to learn enough about it not only to apply it but to realize that I actually enjoy it. :)
